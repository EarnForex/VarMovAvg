# VarMovAvg

VarMovAvg is a custom MT4/MT5/cTrader indicator coded by EarnForex.com. The indicator is based on earlier versions developed by _GOODMAN_ & _Mstera_ & _AF_. It calculates a special kind of adaptable moving average that uses the signal-to-noise ratio in its formula.

The indicator shows clear buy and sell signals and supports all types of alerts.
